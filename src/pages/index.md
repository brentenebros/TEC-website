    Knowledge is power. 

    Sometimes that knowledge resides in the secrecy of closed deals and
    pre-patent research. 

    Sometimes that wisdom resides in the crowd.

    The rLoop Network is a Decentralized Exponential Organization designed to
    connect individuals and organizations to collaborate on emergent
    technologies in ways that were never before possible.

    The rLoop Network is a fork of the Ark blockchain. An rLoop branded wallet
    is available for download at rLoop.org for both desktop and mobile devices,
    and rLoop may be added to any Ark desktop wallet using the RLP network hash
    ID.



    rLoop is a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) blockchain, in which XX active
    delegates are voted on by token holders to secure and maintain the network.
    As such, the RLP network is ultimately owned and controlled by the users
    through their voting for the delegates. There is an inflation rate
    determined by a constant 2 RLP tokens per block forged by the delegate
    creating the block, with a new block created every 8 seconds, resulting in
    an initial inflation of 6.31% for the first year, 5.93% for the second year,
    the percentage of which decreases with each subsequent year with the
    constant creation rate of new RLP ending with 4.02% in the 10th year. DPoS
    has proven to be a fast, reliable, and efficient blockchain technology
    requiring far less energy and computing resources than other consensus
    methods.



    Ark based wallets are very secure and easier to use than most other
    blockchain wallets, and do not require the download and installation of the
    entire blockchain. A hardware USB device, the Ledger Nano, is available from
    Ledger.io to further secure the desktop wallet from hacks and keystroke
    loggers, and is highly recommended for any significant crypto holdings of
    supported tokens, including RLP, Ark, and Ark based tokens. Unlike other
    Ledger wallets, the Ark based wallets are standalone, not requiring Chrome
    browser extensions or use in any browser.



    The rLoop token is a utility token that allows access to the innovation
    platform and certain privileges within, as well as the products, services,
    and intellectual property that the rLoop community may offer. It does not
    represent any equity share in rLoop Corp., and there is no guarantee of any
    value other than in exchange for offerings by rLoop at an exchange rate to
    be determined by rLoop which will likely vary according to prevailing market
    conditions. There is also no guarantee that RLP tokens will be listed on an
    exchange since that is up to the individual exchanges, and not under the
    control or determined by rLoop.
